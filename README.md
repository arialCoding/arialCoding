## 🕹️ Game Developer | 🧠 Low-Level Programming Enthusiast | 🧵 beginner OS dev

I'm TR, a passionate beginner game developer with a strong love for understanding **how things work under the hood**. I enjoy diving into the **lowest levels of code**, building things from scratch, and challenging myself to explore the foundational layers of computing.

### 🚧 Currently Working On:
- 🧱 **Creating my own kernel** — not for world domination (yet), but to deeply understand how operating systems tick.
- 🎮 **Game development projects** — small experiments and prototypes as I improve my skills.
- 🧮 **Learning systems programming** — digging into C, assembly, memory management, and beyond.
- 🧮 **Web developpment** — Also learning to become a full stack developper
---

### 🔧 Skills I'm Building:
- C / C++
- Assembly (x86_64)
- Operating System fundamentals
- Graphics programming
- Game loop mechanics
- Web development

### 🧪 Philosophy:
> Why use a library when you can suffer and learn building your own?

I believe that struggling through the hard stuff is what makes a great programmer. Whether it’s rendering a pixel to the screen in a bare-metal environment or getting that first character to move in a custom-built engine — **I’m here for the journey, not just the result**.
